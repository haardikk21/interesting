Will use the **'If I don't do X, Y happens'** approach

- **Wednesday April 17th**

  - Work on converting system to talk with blockchain throughout existing endpoints.
    - If I don't do this, I cannot add other endpoints and am blocking the work required for FlexFinTx to succeed.

- **Thursday April 18th**:

  - Continue work on converting system to talk with blockchain throughout existing endpoints
    - If I don't do this, I am blocking future work and FlexFinTx from succeeding

    - If I don't do this, I am representing UWBC poorly

  - Start adding new endpoints for other models on the network
    - If I don't do this, I cannot start integrating SMS/USSD and am blocking future work and FlexFinTx from succeeding
  - Explore Algorand TestNet, and set up a test node on my device
    - If I don't do this, I cannot start writing the blog post for Algorand and represent UWBC poorly
  - Start making notes on the testnet setup
    - If I don't do this, I won't have content for the blog post and just wasted time exploring the testnet

    - If I don't do this, I cannot start integrating SMS/USSD and am blocking future work and FlexFinTx from succeeding

  - Call UWBC executive position applicants, and explain to them the UWBC vision, what we do, why we do it, and get to learn more about their past experiences, why they're interested in it, and their goals and expectations from working for UWBC
