# Naval Ravikant Farman Podcast

- Reading what everyone is reading, leads to thinking what everyone else is thinking We need diversity. Social approval is inside the herd. If you want social approval, definitely go read what the herd is reading.
- Why the smartest and most successful people started out all losers is because if you view yourself as a loser, as someone who was cast out of society, then you do your own thing and you’re much more likely to find that winning path.
- A lot of our unhappiness also comes from comparing things from the past to the present.
- Ill start reading a book from the beginning, but I’ll move fast. If its not interesting, Ill just flip ahead and skim or speed read. If it doesn’t grab my attention in a positive way, Ill either drop the book or skip ahead a few chapters.
- Decision making is everything. Someone who makes decisions right 80% of the time instead of 70% of the time, will be valued and compensated hundreds of times more. I think people have a hard time understanding that. If im managing 1 billion $ and im right 10% of the time than somebody else, then that’s 100 million $ worth of value on a judgement call.
- Decision making is a memory prediction machine. It has a memory of things that worked in the past and what it’s read and it’s trying to predict the future.
- The best mental models that I have found have come through evolution, game theory, and Charlie Munger (Warren Buffets partner). Nassim Taleeb and Benjamin Franklin had great mental models.
- Humans are ignorant and bad at predicting the future. I don’t have the ability to say what is going to work. Rather, what I try to do is eliminate what’s not going to work.
- I don’t want to be the most successful person on the planet. I just want to be the most successful version of me while working the least hard as possible.
- As an investor, I would see 10000 companies and I want to pick 500 that have a shot of being huge. Then I want the option to double down on the five winners. I don’t want to look at 100 and pick 10 that I thin Kare winners ad go all in on those.

### How do you determine you trust someone?

- Integrity is the hardest one. Two ways - long term, when you’ve known someone for a while and you know how they think about things. Two - short term. You just see how they treat other people. Lots people who will not screw over, but they will do something that is self dealing or slightly unethical relative to another business partner. They say “im taking advantage of him because they deserve it. You’re my friend and I would never do that to you”.
- People who do things out of integrity, that have an internal moral compass. They don’t do unfair, unethical, or bad deals with other people which soils their own view. If someone is going around talking about how honest they are, they’re probably being dishonest.
- Con men will push the deal a little too hard, they’ll sell a little too hard, they’ll talk about how honest they are.
- If you have too many moral shortcomings, things you did to other people, you will not respect yourself. The worst outcome in the world is not having self esteem. If you don’t love yourself, who will?
- To find a worthy mate, be worthy of a worthy mate.
- If ethical was profitable, everybody would do it. We wouldn’t talk about it. Won’t need books about it. But they’re not. Its obviously unprofitable. It involves sacrifices.
- Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. If you’re making hard choices right now in what to eat, you’re not eating junk food you want and making the hard choice to workout, then your life long term will be easy. Won’t be sick, unhealthy. Same is true for values.
- Intelligence: if someone is using a lot of fancy words and big concepts, they probably don’t know what they are talking about. I think the smartest people can explain things to a child, if you can’t explain it to a child then you don’t know it.
- True understanding is about algorithms, how things connect to each other. Its a mark of a genius to explain complicated things in simple ways.
- I think the really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at the fundamental level. If you can’t rederive from the basics if needed, you’re lost.
- In business, if something isn’t going well. I try to acknowledge that publicly in front of cofounders and friends and coworkers. That way, im not hiding it from them or anybody else. If im not hiding it from anybody, im not going to basically delude myself for what’s actually going on.
- Vision without execution is a hallucination.

### Life and Happiness

- In tech, there’s a lot of luck required. Right time, right place, market forces, timing, regulatory action. You can never predict the outside successes, but you can predict the failures. You can say, this person doesn’t know the field at all. They’re way out of their depth. This person, they’re a short term thinker. Theyree not going to last the game. Not going to go as far as needed.
- You have to be irrationally optimistic to succeed and passionate. You also have to really know your stuff.
- Great people have great outcomes. You just have to be patient.
- I think the most common mistake if I look at how they’re on planet earth, for humanity, is the idea or the belief that you’re going to be made happy because of some external circumstance. Thats buddhist wisdom.
- The mistake over and over and over is to say “Oh ill be happy when I get that thing, whatever that is” and all of us do it.
- The meaning of life is personal. You have to find your meaning. Any piece of wisdom anybody else gives you, will sound like nonsense. You have to find the answer for yourself and what makes you happy. It may take you years or decades, that will be fundamental to your life
- You’ve been dead for 10 billion years or more, you will be dead for the next billions of years until death of the universe. Anything you do will fade. Just like the human race will disappear and the planet will disappear. Get to Mars, even they are going to disappear. Nobody is going to remember you past a certain number of generations. Theres no meaning.
- I met this entrepreneur obsessed with Steve Jobs, and he was making all these sacrifices trying to be like him. I asked him, Do you want to be exactly like Steve Jobs right now? He said Yes. I said Steve jobs is dead. He doesn’t care about anything or anyone. You don’t want to be him. Just be you, right now. He would trade places with you right now in an instant if he could.
